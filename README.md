# Customer_Churn_Prediction
The project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service, such as a telecommunications company, using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscription or stop using the service. By identifying customers at risk of churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering incentives or personalized promotions.
